### Phase 2 Progress
* Added several new parameters into our dataset:
   * Weather ratings (normal, good, bad, very poor)
   * Breathing conditions for games played at a high elevation (normal, difficult)
   * Elo ratings of teams playing one another (to account for additional dimensions like strength of schedule)
   * Recent scoring history (average points given up and scored over last 3 games)
   * Adding a Grid Search and multiple models for testing.
   * Added a results table
